# Preventing SQL injection attacks

To mitigate SQL injection attacks, the following measures can be taken:

- Use prepared statements or parameterized queries to ensure that user input is properly sanitized before being executed as part of an SQL query.
- Implement input validation to ensure that user input is restricted to the expected data types and formats.
- Use least privilege access control to ensure that user accounts only have access to the data and functionality that they need to perform their tasks.
