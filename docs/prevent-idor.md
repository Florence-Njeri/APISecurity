# Preventing IDOR attacks

To mitigate IDOR attacks, the following measures can be taken:

- Implement proper access controls and permissions to ensure that users can only access the data and functionality that they are authorized to access.
- Use unpredictable object references such as UUIDs instead of sequential IDs that can be easily guessed or manipulated.
- Implement proper error handling to avoid exposing implementation details in error messages that may help attackers in their attempts to exploit IDOR vulnerabilities.
