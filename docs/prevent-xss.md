# Preventing cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks

To mitigate XSS attacks, the following measures can be taken:

- Implement proper input validation and data sanitization to ensure that user input is restricted to the expected data types and formats.
- Use Content Security Policy (CSP) to restrict the sources of executable scripts and prevent unauthorized scripts from being executed.
- Use HttpOnly and Secure flags on cookies to prevent XSS attacks that attempt to steal session cookies.
