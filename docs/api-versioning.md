# Implementing API versioning to ensure backward compatibility and security

API versioning backwards compatibility will allow developers to change the existing APIs without affecting clients using the older versions of the APIs. Clients using the newer API versions will benefit from having access to new features and and security updates.

These strategies should be put in place to ensure backward compatibility of the APIs:

- Monitor API usage and error rates to detect any issues with backward compatibility. This can include tracking API response times, error rates, and usage patterns to detect any changes in API behavior that may indicate a backward compatibility issue.
- Use automated testing to test for changes in API response formats, query parameters, and error messages.
