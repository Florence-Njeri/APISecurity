# Implementing rate limiting to prevent DDoS attacks

To mitigate DDoS attacks, the following measures can be taken:

- Implement **rate limiting** to limit the number of requests that can be made to the API from a single IP address or user account.
- Use a **content delivery network** (CDN) to distribute traffic and absorb DDoS attacks.
- Use **load balancers** to distribute traffic across multiple servers and prevent a single server from being overwhelmed.
