# Introduction to API Security

An API, or Application Programming Interface, is a tool that facilitates communication between different applications. For example, if an application like Twitter has an API, third-party clients can use it to make requests. APIs often allow for the creation, reading, and modification of sensitive information stored in an organization's systems.

However, third-party access to APIs can also pose significant risks to data security. If sensitive information about an application or its users is accessed by unauthorized parties, it can result in a data breach. Therefore, API security is critical to protect the data accessed, created, or updated by these interfaces from security attacks.

API security involves implementing processes and measures to safeguard APIs from vulnerabilities that could lead to unauthorized access. Since APIs are often exposed to the public, they are at higher risk of exploitation by malicious actors who seek to compromise the integrity and confidentiality of transmitted data. By prioritizing API security, organizations can ensure the privacy and security of their sensitive information.

In the next section, you'll learn about some of the most common types of API attacks.
