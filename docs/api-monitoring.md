# Implementing API monitoring to detect and prevent suspicious activity

Monitor API activity to detect anomalies that might be attacks. Insufficient monitoring systems give bad actors the time they need to access API resources without getting detected. Real-time monitoring of all APIs, including shadow APIs, third-party APIs, and outdated or deprecated technology should be done to detect some of these attacks e.g DDOS, data exfiltration etc.

Monitor failed login attempts especially ones happening concurrently close in time since that could be a sign of an automated brute force attack.
